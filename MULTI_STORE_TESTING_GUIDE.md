## 🧪 Complete Testing Workflow

### **Step 1: Login as Super Admin**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login with admin credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@example.com`
   - **Password**: `Admin123!`

### **Step 2: Create Multiple Stores**
1. Navigate to **"Store Management"** (admin-only menu)
2. Click **"Add Store"**
3. Create stores like:
   - **Store 1**: "Downtown Store" (123 Main St, New York)
   - **Store 2**: "Mall Location" (456 Mall Ave, Los Angeles)
   - **Store 3**: "Airport Kiosk" (789 Airport Blvd, Chicago)

### **Step 3: Create Store-Specific Users**
1. Go to **"Users"** page
2. Create new users for each store:
   - **Store Admin**: `storeadmin1@test.com` (assign to Downtown Store)
   - **Cashier 1**: `cashier1@test.com` (assign to Downtown Store)
   - **Store Admin 2**: `storeadmin2@test.com` (assign to Mall Location)
   - **Cashier 2**: `cashier2@test.com` (assign to Mall Location)

### **Step 4: Assign Users to Stores**
1. Go back to **"Store Management"**
2. For each store, click **"Manage Users"**
3. Assign the created users to their respective stores
4. Assign appropriate roles (Admin, Cashier, etc.)

### **Step 5: Test Store-Specific Access**
1. **Logout** from admin account
2. **Login as Store Admin 1** (`storeadmin1@test.com`)
3. Navigate to **"Store Dashboard"** for their assigned store
4. Verify they only see data for their specific store

### **Step 6: Test Direct Sales**
1. **Login as Cashier 1** (`cashier1@test.com`)
2. Go to their **Store Dashboard**
3. Click **"Direct Sale"**
4. Create a direct sale:
   - Customer: "John Doe"
   - Add products from the store
   - Complete the sale
5. Verify inventory is reduced automatically

### **Step 7: Test Multi-Store Order Management**
1. **Login as regular user** (create one if needed)
2. Go to **POS** page
3. Create an order (this goes to admin dashboard)
4. **Login as admin** and process the order
5. Verify order appears in the correct store's dashboard

## 🔍 API Testing with cURL

### **Test Store Management APIs**

```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5152/api/Auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"Admin123!"}' | jq -r '.accessToken')

# Get all stores
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5152/api/StoreManagement/stores

# Create a new store
curl -X POST http://localhost:5152/api/StoreManagement/stores \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Store",
    "address": "123 Test St",
    "city": "Test City",
    "phoneNumber": "555-0123",
    "managerName": "Test Manager"
  }'

# Get store dashboard
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5152/api/StoreManagement/stores/1/dashboard
```

### **Test Direct Sales APIs**

```bash
# Get store products
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5152/api/DirectSales/store/1/products

# Create direct sale
curl -X POST http://localhost:5152/api/DirectSales/create-sale \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "storeId": 1,
    "customerName": "Test Customer",
    "customerEmail": "customer@test.com",
    "customerPhone": "555-0123",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": 1,
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": 10.00
      }
    ]
  }'

# Get store direct sales
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5152/api/DirectSales/store/1
```
